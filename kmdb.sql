-- In this assignment, you'll be building the domain model, database 
-- structure, and data for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database).
-- The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the 
-- top-billed cast for each movie in the database.

-- Requirements/assumptions
--
-- - The database will have three movies in it to start – the three films
--   that make up Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.
-- - Movie data includes the movie title, year released, MPAA rating,
--   and studio.
-- - There are many studios, and each studio produces many movies, but
--   a movie belongs to a single studio.
-- - An actor can be in multiple movies.
-- - An actor is represented by an agent.
-- - Everything you need to do in this assignment is marked with TODO!
-- * Note rubric explanation for appropriate use of external resources.

-- User stories
--
-- - As a guest, I want to see a list of movies with the title, year released,
--   MPAA rating, and studio information.
-- - As a guest, I want to see the movies which a single studio has produced.
-- - As a guest, I want to see each movie's cast including each actor's
--   name and the name of the character they portray.
-- - As a guest, I want to see the movies which a single actor has acted in.
-- - As an agent, I want to assign myself as representing an actor.
-- - As an agent, I want to see only the list of actors I represent.
-- * Note: The "guest" user role represents the experience prior to logging-in
--   to an app and typically does not have a corresponding database table.

-- Deliverables
-- 
-- There are five deliverables for this assignment, all delivered as part of
-- this repository and submitted via GitHub and Canvas:
--
-- - An ERD (entity relationship diagram) illustrating the entities and
--   relationships in this data model.
-- - Implementation of the ERD via CREATE TABLE statements for each
--   model/table. Include DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements for each
--   table, so that each run of this script starts with a blank database.
-- - Insertion of initial sample data into tables.
-- - Selection of data, so that something similar to the sample "report"
--   below can be achieved.

-- Rubric
--
-- 1. Domain model / ERD - 6 points
-- - Draw an ERD (entity relationship diagram) with and add it as a file
--   named "erd" (any image file extension type is acceptable).
-- - Think about how the domain model needs to reflect the
--   "real world" entities and the relationships with each other. 
--   Hint #1: It's not just a single table that contains everything in the 
--   expected output. There are multiple real world entities and
--   relationships including at least one many-to-many relationship.
--   Hint #2: Do NOT name one of your models/tables “cast” or “casts”; this 
--   is a reserved word in sqlite and will break your database! Instead, 
--   think of a better word to describe this concept; i.e. the relationship 
--   between an actor and the movie in which they act.
-- 2. Execution of the domain model (CREATE TABLE) - 4 points
-- - Follow best practices for table and column names
-- - Use correct data column types (i.e. TEXT/INTEGER)
-- - Use of the `model_id` naming convention for foreign key columns
-- 3. Insertion of data (INSERT statements) - 4 points
-- - Insert data into all the tables you've created.
-- 4. Modification of existing data (UPDATE statements) - 2 points
-- - Assign an agent as the representative of a single actor.
-- 5. "The report" (SELECT statements) - 4 points
-- - Write 3 `SELECT` statements to produce (a) list of movies with their studio,
--   (b) list of cast for each movie, and (c) list of actors the "agent" (i.e. user)
--   is assigned to represent. See the "TODO" sections below and the sample output.
--   You will need to read data from multiple tables in each `SELECT` statement.
--   Formatting does not matter.
-- 6. Using external resources for help with the assignment (including colleagues, AI, internet search, etc):
-- - Engineers look to colleagues and the internet all the time when building software.
--   You are welcome to do the same. However, the solution you submit must utilize
--   the skills and strategies covered in class. Alternate solutions which do not demonstrate
--   an understanding of the approaches used in class will receive significant deductions.
--   Any concern should be raised with faculty prior to assignment due date.

-- Submission
-- 
-- - "Use this template" to create a brand-new "hw1" repository in your
--   personal GitHub account, e.g. https://github.com/<USERNAME>/hw1
-- - Do the assignment, committing and syncing often
-- - When done, commit and sync a final time, before submitting the GitHub
--   URL for the finished "hw1" repository as the "Website URL" for the 
--   Homework 1 assignment in Canvas

-- Successful sample output is as shown:

-- Turns column mode on but headers off
.mode column
.headers off

-- Drop existing tables, so you'll start fresh each time this script is run.
-- TODO!
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movie;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS studio;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS actor;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS character;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS agent;
-- Create new tables, according to your domain model
-- TODO!
